{"input_tokens": 331, "output_tokens": 107, "text": "The provided image is not an MRI brain scan.  It's an ultrasound image, and it's not of the brain.  The image shows a breast ultrasound in the anti-radial plane. There appears to be a hypoechoic (darker) lesion in the breast tissue,  but without more information (patient history, clinical findings, etc.), a specific diagnosis cannot be given.  The image alone is insufficient for a radiologist to make a definitive diagnosis; further information and possibly additional imaging would be needed.\n"}
